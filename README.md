This graph displays the contributors to a the PyGithub repo over the period 1st November 2018 to 26th November 2019.

## Description
I tried to use the linux repo but with over 20,000 contributors and over 800,000 commits, it was not ideal with regard to time.
I used the PyGithub repo which has 190 contributors and 1,725 commits.
