![Graph 1 Year](https://github.com/TheCsWorld/Github-Access/blob/master/Graph%201%20year.png)

This graph displays the contributors to a the PyGithub repo over the period 1st November 2018 to 26th November 2019.</br>
The purpose of theis graph is to determine the contributors who commits most frequently to a repo as shown over a period of time.

## Description
I tried to use the linux repo but with over 20,000 contributors and over 800,000 commits, it was not ideal with regard to time.
I used the PyGithub repo which has 190 contributors and 1,725 commits.</br>
I obtained information on the number of commits contributors to the repo made over the past year. I created a dataframe with all the contributors who contributed to thr repo over the past year, the dates of the commits and a count that increases by one for each commit per author. My graph uses the date of commit as the x-axis and the commit count for the y-axis. The graph allows the viewer to select individual contributors and view the data over a 1 month, 3 month, 6 month or one year timeframe. I wanted to gather data for second repo such as Node.js and compare the number of contributors with commits over the same time period but I was not able to achieve this in time for the deadline. This repo contains the code to gather and graph the data, along with sceenshots of the graph over 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year with a video showing the functionality of the graph (i.e. isolating an individual contributor, highlighting commits and showing the data in one of the given timeframes).
